### Introduction:
This is an example of the creational design pattern called "Singleton" for an app that helps you learn about design patterns, you can find that app [here](https://github.com/JoseMartinez117/AppPatrones "here").

#### About: 
The example explains the use of the Singleton using the Creaking from Minecraft. It only allows the creation of one Creaking per Creaking Hearth, and only admits a new Creaking for that Creaking Hearth in the case that the previous Creaking has died.

#### Documentation: 
The documentation of the methods and classes created for the example is in the [Javadoc](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Singleton/tree/master/JavaDoc "Javadoc") folder. 

You can check the coverage of the unitary test created for this proyect in the [htmlReport](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Singleton/tree/master/htmlReport "htmlReport") folder, you can create more test for your own methods.
